# HOST, IP AND NETWORK
***Host -*** Any device which sends or recives traffic(Data). [e.g computer, phone, server, IoT devices, printer, cloud servers].

***Client -***  Device that intiates request.

***Server -***  Device that responds.

- ***Note -*** Client and server are relative terms depends on specific communication.

Every host on the internet has IP address. IP is unique identifier for each host on n/w.

IP Address- 32 bits `01000101001010100011100010100101`, Containing 4 chunks `01000101`, `00101010`, `00111000`, `10100101` => `69`.`42`.`56`.`165`. Each with range 0-255 as 8bit min_value=0 & max_value=255

***Network(n/w) -*** Host are connected to each other through n/w. Logical grouping of hosts.

Before n/w transferring data required portable media (Disk, CD, penDrives etc)

We can have nested networks (Subnet)
E.g. => An org > 3 diff offices at diff location > diff teams[hr, dev, finance] have own n/w .

# [Switch, Router] & [Repeater,Hub and Bridge]

***Repeaters -*** It regenrates signals, NEED- allowing comm. across long distances.
***Hub -*** It is multi-port repeter. NEED- Connecting hosts directly to each other does not scale, hub gives a centalise space for hosts to connect.
